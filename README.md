# Emojilution Match

Towards a simple GPS-based match-tiles android game. Place the randomly chosen next tile to make sets of three, then sets of three of the second-level glyphs. Each evolution path is represented by a sequence of emoji on a common theme such as sea creatures. Place a tile by walking to the correct place and then clicking on the square; it wraps round so you can play while walking along.

To be considered finished it needs several things notably including:

* Change any remaining references to http://opensudoku.moire.org/ to refer to an emojilution match URL.
* Save the game state using the existing save game code.
